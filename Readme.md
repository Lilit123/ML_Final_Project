# TATA Stock Price Prediction

In this paper, we will work with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. We will implement the Machine Learning algorithms to predict the future stock price, starting with simple algorithms, and then move on to advanced techniques:

  - Linear Regression
  - k-NN algorithm
  - ARIMA
  - Facebook Prophet
  - LSTM
